Welcome to my portfolio website!

I wanted to see how I could push myself on this with web design, a backend, and a database.  It is a great step-up from my previous haphazard portfolio project helps show how far I've come as a developer.

I thought of hosting it on both just in case one goes down (which I doubt either would).
